# Phase F2: Foundation — Adapters, Testing & Mobile Scaffolding

## Role

You are the same **Senior Platform Engineer** from Phases F1a and F1b, continuing foundation work. This session builds the adapter layer, test infrastructure, and mobile scaffolding.

## POC Context

This is a high-quality POC. Everything you build here must enable squads to write tests confidently and build UI consistently.

## Context

Read:
1. `/home/claude/agentic-bank/CLAUDE.md` — project conventions (created in Phase F1a)
2. `docs/prompts/00-MASTER-PROMPT.md` — master prompt
3. `docs/neobank-v2/03-architecture/system-architecture.md` — system architecture
4. `docs/neobank-v2/03-architecture/api-design.md` — API contracts
5. `docs/neobank-v2/03-architecture/data-model.md` — data model
6. `docs/neobank-v2/06-final-plan/delivery-plan.md` — delivery plan (for Foundation scope)

Also review:
- `apps/api/src/tools/handlers.ts` — current tool handlers (to refactor)
- `apps/api/src/tools/definitions.ts` — current tool definitions
- `apps/api/src/services/agent.ts` — agent loop
- `apps/api/src/__tests__/` — existing test setup and mocks
- `packages/shared/` — shared types (created in F1b) and test constants (created in F1a)
- All 3 squad test plans: `docs/neobank-v2/05-squad-plans/*/test-plan.md` — review "Test Data Requirements" sections for MockBankingAdapter configuration needs

## Session Scope

This is **Foundation session 3 of 3**. Phase F1a (data layer) and F1b (code layer) must both be complete before this session starts.

## Resuming a Session

If your session runs out of context, the next session should:
1. Read CLAUDE.md
2. Run `git log --oneline -10` to see completed tasks
3. Resume from the next incomplete task in this prompt

### Task 5: Mobile Scaffolding

Set up the mobile app structure:
- Navigation structure (chat-first home, tab/stack navigation for drill-downs)
- Design system foundation (tokens: colors, spacing, typography)
- Base components (cards, buttons, inputs, loading skeletons, error states)
- API client setup with proper error handling
- State management setup

### Task 4a: Banking Port Interface and Mock Adapter

> **Reference:** `docs/neobank-v2/03-architecture/mock-strategy.md` is the consolidated mock documentation. This task implements what that document specifies. Read it first for the full picture (architecture, data tables, read/write paths, known gaps, test API).

Refactor the direct `GriffinClient` usage into a hexagonal architecture.

**1. Define `BankingPort` interface** (type defined in F1b's shared types, implementation here).

The canonical interface is defined in `system-architecture.md §5.1` and consolidated in `mock-strategy.md §3`. Implement that full interface (18+ methods covering accounts, pots, beneficiaries, payments, transactions, standing orders, onboarding, and health check). Do NOT use Griffin-style URL-based signatures — use `userId`-based domain names (e.g., `getBalance(userId)` not `getBalance(accountUrl)`).

**Scope clarification:** The BankingPort covers accounts, pots, beneficiaries, payments, transactions, standing orders, and onboarding. Pot rules, pot transactions (ledger), direct debits, loans, and insights are managed **locally in Supabase** and do NOT go through the BankingPort. See `mock-strategy.md §2.3` for the full coverage table.

**2. Create `GriffinAdapter`** in `apps/api/src/adapters/griffin.adapter.ts`:
- Wraps existing `GriffinClient`
- Normalises Griffin's kebab-case responses into domain types
- All existing Griffin calls route through this adapter

**3. Create `MockBankingAdapter`** in `apps/api/src/adapters/mock-banking.adapter.ts`:

The mock adapter should accept an optional `fixtures` configuration in its constructor for test-time overrides. In default mode (dev/demo), it loads a default dataset matching the seed data. In test mode, tests configure returns per-method via a `configure(method, returnValue)` pattern:

```typescript
const mock = new MockBankingAdapter();
mock.configure('getBalance', { balance: '0.00', currency: 'GBP' }); // Override for this test
```

Key design decisions:
- **Must expose a `reset()` method** that restores initial state. Test `beforeEach` should call `reset()` for test isolation.
- **Do NOT maintain in-memory balance state.** When a payment is made through the mock, the tool handler should update the local `accounts` table balance in Supabase directly. The `check_balance` tool handler should call `BankingPort.getBalance()` — the adapter decides where to read from (mock reads from local `accounts` table, real adapter calls Griffin API). This makes demo state persistent across server restarts and consistent with what the mobile app shows.
- **`listTransactions` must return enriched data** (with merchant_name, category, description) — not raw Griffin format. For the POC, the mock IS the enrichment layer. Mock transactions are pre-categorised.
- Supports error simulation: `mock.configure('getBalance', new Error('Service unavailable'))` to test error handling.
- Simulates realistic delays (100-500ms) in dev mode, instant in test mode.
- **Default values must match `packages/shared/src/test-constants.ts`.** Import from test constants, don't duplicate values.

**4. Critical: Transaction read path refactoring.**

The `get_transactions` tool handler must read from the **local `transactions` Supabase table** (which has enriched data with merchant_name and category), NOT from `BankingPort.getTransactions()`. The BankingPort's `getTransactions` is reserved for sync purposes only. This ensures:
- Spending analytics work (they query the local enriched table)
- Mock and real modes behave identically
- No sync service needed for the POC

Similarly, `check_balance` should call `BankingPort.getBalance()` — the adapter decides the data source (mock reads from local `accounts` table, real adapter calls Griffin API).

**5. Transaction write path.**

After a successful write operation through the BankingPort (e.g., payment submitted), the handler must insert a corresponding enriched row into the local `transactions` table. For the MockBankingAdapter, the handler creates the transaction row directly. Add a TODO comment: `// TODO: Replace with webhook-based transaction sync for production`

**6. Wire up via dependency injection:**
- `USE_MOCK_BANKING=true` or `NODE_ENV=test` → `MockBankingAdapter`
- Otherwise → `GriffinAdapter`
- Inject into tool handlers (refactor `handlers.ts` to accept the port instead of importing `GriffinClient` directly)

**7. Review all 3 squad test plans** (Section 1: Test Data Requirements) for MockBankingAdapter configuration needs. The mock adapter must support all data states listed across all squads.

### Task 6: Test Infrastructure

Set up testing patterns:
- Unit test setup and mocks (update existing Supabase/Anthropic mocks)
- Contract test utilities (helper to define and verify API contracts)
- Test coverage configuration

Add a **conversation reconstruction test**: Write a test that inserts 3 turns of structured `content_blocks` (including `tool_use` and `tool_result` blocks) into the messages table, loads them via `getConversationHistory()`, and asserts the result is valid Anthropic `MessageParam[]`. This verifies the M-2 fix works with all block types.

### Task 6a: Test Fixtures

Create `apps/api/src/__tests__/fixtures/` with standardised data.

**Important: All fixture values must be imported from or match `packages/shared/src/test-constants.ts`.** Do not hardcode values that exist in test-constants.

**`users.ts`** — Named user objects:
- `ALEX_USER`: Full `UserProfile` matching demo seed data (display_name: "Alex Chen", griffin URLs populated)
- `EMMA_USER`: User with no griffin URLs (incomplete onboarding)
- `NO_ACCOUNT_USER`: User with `griffin_legal_person_url` but no `account_url`

**`accounts.ts`** — Account and pot fixtures:
- `ALEX_ACCOUNT`: Local account record matching seed data (balance from test-constants)
- `ALEX_POTS`: Array of 3 savings pots matching seed data (Holiday Fund, Emergency Fund, House Deposit)
- `ALEX_POT_RULES`: Array of pot rules matching seed data

**`griffin-responses.ts`** — Typed BaaS response objects (for MockBankingAdapter default returns):
- `ALEX_BALANCE_RESPONSE`: Balance matching test-constants
- `ALEX_PAYEES_RESPONSE`: 6 beneficiaries matching seed data (5 domestic + 1 international)
- `PAYMENT_CREATED_RESPONSE`: Response from creating a payment
- `PAYMENT_SUBMITTED_RESPONSE`: Response from submitting a payment
- `EMPTY_PAYEES_RESPONSE`: Empty payee list
- `ERROR_RESPONSE`: Simulated service error

**`transactions.ts`** — Transaction fixtures:
- `ALEX_RECENT_TRANSACTIONS`: 10 recent enriched transactions from local table (with merchant_name, category)
- `ALEX_MONTHLY_SPENDING`: Pre-computed spending by category for current month — imported from test-constants

**`payments.ts`** — Payment fixtures:
- `ALEX_BENEFICIARIES`: Array of 6 beneficiaries matching seed data (5 domestic + 1 international, local table format)
- `ALEX_STANDING_ORDERS`: Array of standing orders matching seed data
- `ALEX_DIRECT_DEBITS`: Array of direct debits matching seed data
- `PENDING_PAYMENT_ACTION`: A `pending_actions` row for `send_payment` tool

**`loans.ts`** — Loan fixtures:
- `LOAN_PRODUCTS`: Array matching seeded loan products
- `ALEX_ACTIVE_LOAN`: Active loan object for Alex
- `ALEX_DECLINED_APPLICATION`: Declined loan application

**`conversations.ts`** — Conversation history fixtures:
- `BALANCE_CHECK_HISTORY`: `MessageParam[]` for a completed balance check flow (with content_blocks)
- `PAYMENT_FLOW_HISTORY`: `MessageParam[]` for a payment with confirmation
- `MULTI_TURN_HISTORY`: `MessageParam[]` showing context retention across 3+ tool calls

All fixtures must use **consistent IDs, amounts, and dates** imported from test-constants. The `ALEX_MONTHLY_SPENDING` totals must match the transactions generated by `scripts/seed.ts`.

### Task 6b: Agent Test Harness

Create `apps/api/src/__tests__/helpers/agent-test-harness.ts`:

Provide **two testing levels:**

**1. `runAgentLoopTest()` — Agent loop integration tests**

Calls the real `runAgentLoop` function with a mock Anthropic client and the MockBankingAdapter. Tests the orchestration logic:
- Iteration control (MAX_TOOL_ITERATIONS)
- Message persistence (intermediate tool_use/tool_result messages saved to DB)
- `respond_to_user` special handling — **CRITICAL: must persist synthetic `tool_result` after `respond_to_user` tool_use.** Existing code at `agent.ts:158-169` does NOT do this, causing 400 errors on subsequent turns. See api-design.md §3.3.1 for the fix pattern.
- `end_turn` handling
- Error recovery

```typescript
const result = await runAgentLoopTest({
  user: ALEX_USER,
  conversationId: 'test-conv-1',
  userMessage: "What's my balance?",
  anthropicResponses: [
    // First API call returns tool_use
    { stop_reason: 'tool_use', content: [
      { type: 'tool_use', id: 'tu_1', name: 'accounts_check_balance', input: {} }
    ]},
    // Second API call returns respond_to_user
    { stop_reason: 'tool_use', content: [
      { type: 'tool_use', id: 'tu_2', name: 'respond_to_user', input: {
        message: 'Your balance is £2,345.67',
        ui_components: [{ type: 'balance_card', data: { balance: '2345.67' } }]
      }}
    ]},
  ],
});

// Assert on structural properties, not message text (which is controlled by the mock)
expect(result.toolsCalled).toEqual(['accounts_check_balance']);
expect(result.iterations).toBe(2);
expect(result.uiComponents[0].type).toBe('balance_card');
```

**2. `assertToolHandler()` — Tool handler isolation tests**

Tests individual tool handlers with the MockBankingAdapter:

```typescript
const result = await assertToolHandler({
  toolName: 'accounts_check_balance',
  input: {},
  user: ALEX_USER,
  expectedResult: { balance: '2345.67', currency: 'GBP' },
});
```

**3. Confirmation gate E2E test**

Include at least one harness test that exercises the full confirmation flow:
- Agent proposes write action → `pending_action` created in DB
- `executeConfirmedAction` called → MockBankingAdapter executes payment
- Local `transactions` table updated with new transaction row
- Local `accounts` table balance updated

### Update CLAUDE.md

After completing all tasks, update CLAUDE.md with:
- How to use MockBankingAdapter (constructor, `configure()`, `reset()`)
- How to write tests using fixtures (import from `__tests__/fixtures/`)
- How to use the agent test harness (`runAgentLoopTest`, `assertToolHandler`)
- How to run demo reset (`npm run demo:reset`)

## Foundation Retrospective

After completing all F2 tasks, write `docs/neobank-v2/retro-foundation.md`:

1. **What took longer than expected?** Which tasks were hardest?
2. **Pattern issues discovered?** Any patterns from CLAUDE.md that need revision?
3. **MockBankingAdapter ergonomics** — Was it easy to configure? Any API surface improvements needed?
4. **Fixture quality** — Did writing fixtures surface data model issues?
5. **Advice for squads** — Shortcuts, pitfalls, or conventions discovered during Foundation that squads should know about.

This retrospective is read by the first squad session to learn from Foundation experience.
